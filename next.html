        <img class="BuildingPicsLeft group" src="images/shoprite2.jpg" alt="walmart 2303 storefront picture">


        <h1 class="bodytext group">Without Graphic Design there for me because of the Covid Pandemic and shutdown of 2020, and to keep a roof over my head and food on my table, I took a local job in Parsippany, NJ as an Personal Online Shopper at ShopRite #355. I figured it's still retail, but instead of being in a corporate office advertising products in print form, I would actually be in store collecting those same items in the Supermarket. It was honest work and I was there for two successful years. (2020-2022) </h1>

      <h1 class="bodytext group">Next, I had the opportunity to help my family (mom in nearby nursing home) so I moved to Washington, NJ in Warren County as I continued this line of work. (Personal Online Shopper) This time it is with Walmart #2503 in Hackettstown, NJ which is in the Mansfield Township area on Rt. 57. (2022-Present) I was able to find additional success as shown a few pages from now with a March 2024 Associate of the Month Award I earned that I am very proud of. (detailed on the Walmart page on this site.)</h1>

      
      <H1 class="yellowTitleBar group">THURSDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2025</H1>

      <img class="BuildingPicsLeft group" src="images/TC_103025.jpg" alt="my pick run on Oct 30, 2025, Thursday, picture">


      <h1 class="bodytext group">Wow, what a busy day for a Thursday. With the rain doing its thing outside, our group of shoppers were doing great things inside. Just a typical day in North-West New Jersey at Walmart. With it being October 30, 2025, our hearts were set for Halloween fun soon, but our brains were focused in first on production. As you can see in the picture, 160 items were being picked by me in a grocery order. I successfully scanned in 56 items so far.  I had to go all over the store to complete this task, and I did! Speed is most important as it's onto the next order. The most important thing is for the order to be ontime. Pushing our carts throughout the crowded store, finding the correct item, scanning it into the proper blue tote, bagging it and maybe helping a customer who needs something important done are all things we must do to achieve success. It's for sure a balancing act.</h1>

      <h1 class="bodytextYELLOW">With all this being said, my love is still with Graphic Design. In my free time, I spent that time learning Web Design part time, starting in 2020, off the internet with helpful courses from Udemy and with free YouTube platforms. Someday, I will return to this wonderful profession as a strong asset.</h1>
